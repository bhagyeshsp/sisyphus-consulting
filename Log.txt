To do:
- Add "author" to all case-study posts and display them in the post


I have disabled a few utility classes in the utilities.scss related to floats. Need to comb through all includes and layout files to convert the dependent classes to modern styles.

- Created new utility class .header-container and related media queries styles specifically the homepage header.
- Changed the header.html in _includes to flexbox. Need to make such changes to all relevant layout and includes.
