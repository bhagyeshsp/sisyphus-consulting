  <div class="prose mb-4 py-2">
    <p>For most businesses, their collection of Excel sheets or generic software act as whole-and-sole data system. But you and I both know that a <strong>true data system</strong> is more than that. It is a reflection of your business.</p>

<p>That’s why when we work with you, we start from the beginning. And slowly build from there. Instead of writing a long essay on how we do it, let me share our process in brief. So that you can quickly go through it and familiarize yourself with.</p>

<p>Here’s the process we follow:</p>
<h3 id="1-current-system-diagnosis">1. Current system diagnosis</h3>
<p>We start by examining your existing systems. Ask you questions. Try to understand how one piece of information connects to the other. Who needs what information to make what decision at what frequency.
We avoid generic surveys and focus on deep, meaningful interactions. That’s why, we carry out one-on-one interviews, visits, and shadowing. Challenging the status quo is an essential part of our <strong>diagnostic process</strong>.</p>

<p>One more thing, this step is inherently diagnostic. But right away, most <strong>clients start seeing holes</strong> in their processes. And they amend their processes then-and-there.</p>

<h3 id="2-process-mapping">2. Process mapping</h3>
<p>After understanding your processes and challenges, we map out your information flow, processes and systems on a paper. We review this articulation with your team and ask, <strong>“Is this <em>really</em> how your business operates?”</strong>
If it doesn’t align the reality or expectation, your team addresses those gaps.
By the end of this step, we would have developed a shared understanding of:</p>
<ul>
  <li>How the different parts of the system fit with one another</li>
  <li>Role and responsibilities within the system</li>
  <li>What information different people need to make decisions</li>
</ul>

</div>

<h3 id="3-details-gathering">3. Details gathering</h3>
<p>After completing the macro-level process mapping, we move to the <strong>micro level</strong>. So, we take out our fine-tooth comb, gather all data elements associated with each process. We review them carefully and run by you for clarifications and edits. Often, we <strong>end up identifying gaps or duplications</strong> in the current system. For example, if customer satisfaction scores are tracked but not linked to specific staff members, we highlight the need of such a linkage.</p>

<h3 id="4-database-design">4. Database design</h3>
<p>Once we are clear with macro and micro details of your business processes, we design the database structure. At this stage, most standard processes are clear and there is minimal back-and-forth with your team.</p>

<h3 id="5-development-phase">5. Development phase</h3>
<p>We begin developing software system. We <strong>group the relevant parts</strong> of the software elements together and work on them. This is different than the usual practice of working on everything at once. For example, we might start working on customer database and creating entry-level forms first. But keep analytics and dashboards work for later.</p>

<p>This way, after each iteration we will have <strong>something that works</strong> than many things that don’t work. (Well-articulated by Ryan Singer in <a href="https://basecamp.com/shapeup/3.2-chapter-11">Shape Up</a>)</p>

</div>

<h3 id="6-handover">6. Handover</h3>
<p>Once the software is ready and you have used it to your satisfaction, we begin the handover process. Our work follows the philosophy of <strong>customer empowerment</strong>. Which means we aim to reduce client’s dependency on us after our engagement is over. This philosophy drives our decisions about choice of technology and design of our work.</p>

<p>"In our work at Snehalaya CCI, <strong>Bhagyesh's impact</strong> went beyond creating just another IT solution. <strong>He invested time</strong> to understand the unique challenges of child development before designing a system that effectively monitors each child's journey toward independence. What stands out is his <strong>pragmatic approach</strong>—using simple, accessible technology tools rather than complex solutions, while fully meeting our needs.
