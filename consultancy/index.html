    <p>What makes our consultancy services different?</p>

<p>For starters, we are not jack of all trades. We have a specific vision and expertise about a few things and we want to keep capitalizing on it.
<em>Second</em>, we spend a lot of time and effort to understand our clients’ business problems and context. This makes our thinking <strong>the highest value product</strong> we can provide to our clients.
And <em>third</em>, our work is consultative. Which means we directly work with executives and business owners to define strategy and implement it.</p>

<p>This approach is different than other firms, where a client self-diagnoses their problems, self-prescribes a strategy and the firm takes the order.</p>

<p>Now, let’s talk about our consultancy services. We provide services in Technology and Design domains.</p>

<h1 id="technology-services">Technology Services</h1>

<p>We specialize in setting up data systems and online stores for small and medium sized businesses.</p>

<div class="border border-gray p-6 mb-3">
            <h3 class="mb-2">Data System Design</h3>
            <p>We take up this work from scratch. Many businesses rely on Excel sheets or generic software for data storage, analysis and workflows. There is nothing wrong with using them in the early stages. But there comes a time to move beyond Excel. When your intuition tells you that it's time to have a robust, user-friendly way to manage your workflows, we're here to help.</p>

<div class="border border-gray p-6 mb-3">
            <h3 class="mb-2">Meaningful AI-integration</h3>
            <p>Speaking of data system design, no business-owner wants to be left behind when it comes to using AI. Everyone has a question on their mind whether they're too early or too late in considering AI's help in their business processes. In short, a dilemma of <a href="/writing/2025/01/16/to-ai-or-not-to-ai.html">To AI or not to AI</a>.</p>
            <p>We have understood that more or less, every business can benefit from <em>meaningful</em> integration of AI in their work. Not just integration, it has to fit naturally in their business processes.</p>

<div class="border border-gray p-6 mb-3">
            <h3 class="mb-2">Online Store Setup</h3>
            <p>You may have an existing offline business or planning an online-only business. Whichever the case, we'll setup the store for you. This includes: registering your domain, designing your store, uploading your products, setting up payments and more. To do this, we exclusively use Shopify platform. Still, if during our discussion, it seems that some other platform better suits your needs, we'll adapt accordingly.</p>

<h3 class="mb-2">Tech Navigator &nbsp;<img src="/assets/images/mini-service.gif" class="inline-block" style="height: 1.5rem" /></h3>
            <p>If a full tech project is not a good fit for you right now, perhaps a one-on-one strategy call would be helpful to you. We'll do <strong>three one-hour calls</strong> over a period of one week. The goal? To address the most pressing challenges and provide strategy, problem-solving and actionable advice.</p>
            <p>This is the fastest and easiest way to benefit from our expertise without hiring us for a full project.</p>

<h1 id="design-services">Design Services</h1>

<p>For all design services, our <strong>minimum level of engagement</strong> is ₹ 50,000. Half of which is paid upfront.</p>

<div class="border border-gray p-6 mb-3">
<h3 class="mb-2">Brand Identity Design</h3>
<p>Customers are not as rational as Economists assume. They notice how a business made them feel and act accordingly. A generic business leaves it to the customers to build the narrative on their own—and remain undifferentiated.
But a brand? A brand builds the narrative for them. A coherent identity in their customers' mind.</p>

<p>When you hire us, we take care of the look-and-feel part of your identity through our rigorous design process.</p> <a href="/brand-identity-design-process/" class="text-red no-underline bold">Learn about our process &amp; get started →</a>

<div class="border border-gray p-6 mb-3">
<h3 class="mb-2">Illustration Design Work</h3>
<p>We take up clients to sketch illustration designs for their needs. These hand-drawn digital illustrations come in different styles and colours. Different clients approach us with different purposes for illustration work such as, illustrations for:</p>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between;">
