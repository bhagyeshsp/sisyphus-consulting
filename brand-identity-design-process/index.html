  <div class="prose mb-4 py-2">
    <p>Contrary to prevalent belief, a business’s Logo is not their brand identity. And still, many budding and established businesses spend exuberant amount of time and money on their logo and collateral designs. Logo, collaterals, marketing materials—all these <em>emerge</em> from their brand’s identity but they’re <em>not</em> brand’s identity.</p>

<p>When we begin working together, we try to understand how you want to position yourself in the customer’s mind. What type of customers you want to attract and what type of customers you want to pass on. Weaving everything together, we deliver the visual language guidelines for your brand—effectively, turning it into your brand identity.</p>

<p>It is an interesting process. Here’s how we do it:</p>

<h3 id="1-understanding-your-brand">1. Understanding your brand</h3>
<p>Consciously or unconsciously, all businesses act in a specific manner. Business owners and their teams drive this behaviour. It can be their hyper-focus on providing best customer service, refund policies, product quality or any similar thing.</p>

<p>Whatever it may be, we learn about what drives your brand and how you want your brand to be perceived by people. These people can be your existing customers or potential customers. Wherever they come in touch with your brand—through your marketing material, store, web store or social media.</p>

<p>We begin by gaining understanding of your brand’s identity, including its mission, vision, values, and target audience. This step sets the foundation for creating guidelines.</p>

<h3 id="2-defining-core-elements">2. Defining core elements</h3>
<p>After understanding your aspirations and positioning, we begin working on the core elements that influence the look-and-feel part of the brand identity.
There are mainly three elements: logo usage, colour palette and typography.
These three elements work together and give life to your brand’s visual identity in the digital and analogue world.
At the end of this step, we finalize the right colour palette and typography in showcasing your brand’s personality.</p>

<h3 id="3-application-across-platforms">3. Application across platforms</h3>
<p>Before we create the brand guidelines document, first, we create different mock-ups for different touchpoints for your review. They provide you a better idea about how our design decisions look in practice.</p>

<p>The mock-ups may contain:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Marketing materials (flyers, brochures, social media graphics)</li>
  <li>Digital platforms (website, email templates, apps)</li>
  <li>Packaging and merchandise (if applicable)</li>
</ul>

<p>Whatever modification we agree on, will reflect back in core elements. Because everything is dictated by our core elements.</p>

<h3 id="4-brand-guidelines-documentation">4. Brand Guidelines documentation</h3>
<p>As a part of final deliverables, we create a comprehensive, easy-to-follow brand guidelines document. This document will contain guidelines for your graphic designers, web designers and social media teams. Ensuring everyone is on the same page about maintaining a consistent design language across different platforms.</p>

<p>We understand that not everyone can skim through a 30-50 pager brand guidelines on their first attempt. That’s why we also provide a recorded overview of the brand guidelines in a video format. The video decreases the start-up time for any designer.</p>

<h3 id="5-ongoing-support">5. Ongoing support</h3>
<p>We provide different types of paid support after handing over the deliverables. For example, you may want us to look after successful implementation of the brand guidelines by your team. Or you may want us to provide additional design assets for the brand guidelines we have created. We provide such paid support, <em>only</em> for the brand guidelines created by us.</p>

<h4 id="in-summary">In summary</h4>
<p>There are probably 100 different ways to design a brand identity. But we are sticking to this particular process. Apart from developing software or providing design solutions, we are interested in building lasting relationships with a handful of trusted businesses.</p>
