Reusable clothes bags are part of our Indian culture. I wanted to bring the vibrant Indian Bazaar alive on sturdy clothes bags, aka tote bags.

During my next bazaar visit, I had to look at its hustle-bustle through an illustrator's eyes. And I came up with these sketches.

Ultimately, I narrowed down on a collection of scenes. Creating a strip with relevant colour palette and style.

But as expected, the strip alone would be too large to be accomodated on the small bag surface. This is how it came to be at the end of editing and cropping out non-essentials.

As you can see, illustration design is neither exact science nor exact art. It employs high degree of emotional labour. And that's what we do.
