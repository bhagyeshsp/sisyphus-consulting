      <p>Let’s take a use case that addresses the hidden struggles and frustrations of many business owners and managers. We have used Sisyphus Valley School–our prototype application to display this integration.</p>

<h2 id="the-challenge">The challenge</h2>
<p>Most business owners and managers depend on their people or their dashboards to get business insights. They receive these insights in the form of a report or statistics or a photo of an interactive dashboard.
Many times, the people managing the whole business want to explore different scenarios. They want to talk to their data and get answers first-hand. But in current generation of data systems, it is nearly impossible to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Play with their data</li>
  <li>Connect one data point to its related data point for analysis</li>
  <li>Focus solely on business questions instead of analysis techniques</li>
</ul>

<p>Many business owners do conduct their own exploration using tools such as PivotTables in Microsoft Excel or basic dashboard manipulation. But there are two issues in this manual approach: first, the onus of getting the analysis <em>right</em> lies on the technical competency of the owner and second, a dashboard’s analysis is limited by its design.</p>

<h2 id="our-approach">Our approach</h2>
<p>We figured out a way where a business owner can only focus on their business questions and potential insights. They don’t need to worry about whether they selected right Column label in PivotTable. Or feel restricted by their software dashboard.</p>

<p>We trained AI assistant (let’s call it Data Analyst AI) on our database schema, i.e. the database structure. This means, the AI doesn’t have access to the data, just its structure. Look at the sample structure of a Parent’s data element for the Sisyphus Valley School in the following document.</p>

<div class="image-container-caption">
  <img src="/assets/Sisyphus_ParentT_schema.png" alt="Parent data schema" />
  <p>AI has this type of schema information with it</p>
</div>

<p>So, the Data Analyst AI knows what type of data and internal relationships different elements have. When we ask it to come up with an analysis, it refers to them and comes up with a raw analysed data.</p>

<h2 id="in-action">In action</h2>
<p>In this prototype, the software we are using is Microsoft Access. It uses Structured Query Language (SQL) for storage and data analysis. SQL is one of the most widely used database language in the world.
And a business owner or a manager doesn’t need to learn SQL to analyze their data. They can simply ask their business question and the AI will create a SQL query for the system to process.</p>

  <img src="/assets/data_analyst_assistant_ai_screen.png" alt="Data Analyst Assistant AI Screen" />

</div>

<p>The system generates a raw table in answer to our question. We can ask any question related to our data and it will present the first-hand data, without any bias, filter or assumptions.</p>

<h2 id="the-uniqueness-of-such-integration">The uniqueness of such integration</h2>
<p>Smart business owners and managers want to get their hands dirty. They are interested in seeing the data first-hand. This AI integration provides them with numerous benefits:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It increases their independence when it comes to retrieving insights</li>
  <li>It allows them privacy and freedom to ask wrong questions</li>
  <li>It frees them from the rigidness of dashboards</li>
  <li>It makes it easy to find blind spots of their insights and assumptions</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="why-it-matters">Why it matters</h2>
<p>The era of personalized data analysts have arrived. Curious business owners and managers no longer need to depend on a select few confidants to provide insights on their business.</p>

<p>If you’re looking for a meaningful AI integration in your business, CTA.</p>
