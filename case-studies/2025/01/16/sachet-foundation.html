</div>

<p>In August 2023, we were retained by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/sachetfoundation">Sachet Foundation</a>, a budding non-profit helping SORTed adolescents become employable. SORT stands for Slums, Orphanages, Rural and Tribal adolescents.</p>

<p>They hired us to create a customized data system that would support their intervention being deployed in <a href="https://www.snehalaya.org/about">Snehalaya</a>.</p>

<p>By the end of our engagement with Sachet Foundation, we:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Optimized their intervention model structure</li>
  <li>Optimized their intervention processes</li>
  <li>Helped them identify and structure data points required for their successful intervention</li>
  <li>Created an MS Access-based data system for smooth operation</li>
  <li>Trained and educated the staff members in usage of their system</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="what-exactly-we-did-for-sachet-foundation">What exactly we did for Sachet Foundation</h2>

<p>When they hired us, the founders knew what type of data system they needed. They needed to develop their ideas to monitor their beneficiaries with 360 degree view using a data system.</p>

<p>So first, we interviewed the founders, understood their intervention model, visited their beneficiaries and work location. These interactions helped us suggest modifications to their intervention model and processes with two things in mind:</p>
<ol>
  <li>In addition to their proprietary subjective methods, the founders wanted to have objective, evidence-based processes in their decision making.</li>
  <li>The founders wanted to consider future scaling and tracking of their beneficiaries.</li>
</ol>

<p>Next, we gathered all the necessary data points that were <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">must-haves</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">good-to-haves</code>. Structured them, ran by the founders and the team. And developed the database.</p>

<p>Finally, we went through several cycles of development and delivered Sachet Foundation’s data system. This system allowed their staff and new hires to think in terms of designated processes—something that is by design extremely difficult in Excel sheets.</p>

<h2 id="need-to-create-an-efficient-data-system">Need to create an efficient data system?</h2>
<p>It is difficult to create a data system on your own. What works for a fortune 500 company may not work for your business. Each business is unique.
That is what we do. We understand your processes, suggest changes and create data system that works for <em>you</em>.</p>
