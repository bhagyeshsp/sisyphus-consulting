      <p>Animal Farm is a classic book authored by George Orwell. After reading it, I wanted to illustrate my impression in form of a book cover.</p>

<p>You can see some of the process steps that we have laid out in our illustration design practice.</p>

<p>Glimpses of storyboards and design decisions that I made:</p>

<div class="image-container-caption img-full border">
  <img src="/assets/images/case-studies-2.png" alt="Animal Farm Book Cover Design" />
</div>
<p><br /></p>

<p>For colour palette, I referenced past book covers. You can see the recurring theme of colours in all book covers. Because they evoke specific emotions that you feel after reading Animal Farm.</p>

  <img src="/assets/images/case-studies-3.png" alt="Animal Farm Book Cover Design" />
</div>

<p><br /></p>

<p>Orwell’s style is direct, incisive, almost brutal. I chose the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Impact</code> typeface to convey the message.</p>

<div class="image-container-caption img-full border">
  <img src="/assets/images/case-studies-4.png" alt="Animal Farm Book Cover Design" />

<p>Sometimes, we don’t go for colouring right away. And experiment with “underpainting” technique. Eventually, I chose a brighter shade.</p>

<p>The final book cover looked like this:</p>
