Every illustration work is unique in itself. So, we treat each client without assuming their context, use-case and future plans. To do that, we follow this process:

### 1. Context setting
Every project begins with understanding what type of illustrations you need and why. 
The illustrations may be a part of a children's story or a brand requirement or something else---we need to know the details to understand the full context. For example, which media you intend to use: digital, print or both? How big or small they need to be? Are these illustrations going to be character-based: where a character's different aspects are defined by the writer.

Depending on the type of work, at the end of this step, we list out the overall ideas and known elements in the work.
### 2. Inspiration and direction
Having understood the overall vision, in this step, we set out to gather things that shape your vision. For example, if you're the author of the children's book, you may want to walk us through the script and point out the parts that you want us to draw to life.

We gather all the reference material we can get from you: story script, brand guidelines, science concepts, product copy...everything directly related to your illustration work.
Such full context inspires illustrators and informs them about fine details that we normally can't see. That's why *"a jolly school boy that looks like Harry Potter"* is generally unhelpful.

By the end of this step, we would be set for drawing out some draft sketches for you.

### 3. Template copies
Based on our discussions, reference materials and other sources, we produce some draft sketches. The focus would be on layout, perspective and style: what kind of look, ink, style, effects etc aspects.

Next, we work on colour palette for these draft sketches. The colour has to match your vision and emotions that we want to evoke. We colourize the draft sketches with 2-3 colour palette options.

With these coloured draft sketches, we discuss and finalize samples as template copies. Illustrators will use these template copies to create the rest of the illustrations.

### 5. Final copies
By this step, we would have finished creating the required illustrations and shared with you through our [Basecamp workspace](/how-we-work/). Still, if you want any minor modifications, we carry them out. In the end, we handover the files in our agreed format.

#### In summary
There are probably 100 different ways to design illustrations. But we are sticking to this particular process. Apart from developing software or providing design solutions, we are interested in building lasting relationships with a handful of trusted businesses.
