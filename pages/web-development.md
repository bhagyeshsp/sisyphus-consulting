Our expertise lies in developing lightning-fast, responsive and zero-maintenance websites.

What we use:
- Jekyll static site generator
- Free cloud hosting
- Four servers for redundancy and 99.99% uptime

**For example**, this website you're viewing right now, is built using the same framework.

Feels faaaast, doesn't it?

That's what we are talking about.

## What this means for you as a business-owner:
- Zero monthly hosting bills
- A website that loads in under 2 seconds
- No vendor lock-in. You fully own your site
- Easy content updates through a clutter-free dashboard
- Peace of mind with 99.99% uptime
- Mobile responsive

## What's the trade-off?
Only one trade-off. If you want to make major changes to your website, for example: change look and feel, you will need a developer's help. (Assuming you are not proficient in Ruby, HTML, CSS and Javascript yourself. But if you are, you can do it yourself.)

## Then why do we use this framework?
Because the benefits outweigh the trade-off:
- We want to build sites that **load in < 2 seconds** *without* asking the client to spend a fortune in monthly costs. People want ultra-fast websites. If it is going to take more than 2 seconds for our sites to load, we'd rather not build sites at all.
- Fast websites meet our clients' business objectives. They make their **business grow**. And that's ultimately good for our business.
- Clients don't make major redesigns to their websites that often. Major changes come after a **period of 3-5 years**.
- If a client wants major changes after we handover our work, we see it as a sign of lacuna in our process. That's why, we **leave no stone unturned** in getting it right the first time.

And we have our process to help us get it right:

### 1. Background and motivations
We get to know your business first. What it is exactly you're selling, who is your audience, etc. Then we try to understand your needs. What are the reasons behind wanting to setup a website? How will the website contribute to your business or brand?
This is also the stage where you share your media files, logo assets, marketing material, one-pagers etc with us.

### 2. Content-strategy
Once we have understood your background and motivations, we discuss content strategy. The strategy guides the rest of the content steps. For example, we decide what type of tone, tense and person our web copy should have. Following these types of decisions provide a coherent branding to your website.

### 3. Content synthesis
Keeping the strategy as the guiding point, we synthesize content during this step. The content goes through several reviews until we are on the same page.

### 4. Template finalization
After finalizing the content, we need to finalize how the website should look like. For this, we go through different templates from our library or you share some websites that you're inspired by. At the end of this step, we would have agreed on the overall idea of the look and feel of the website.
Needless to say, the website would inherit your brand's colour palette for maximum impact and branding.

### 5. Development
We undertake website development during this step. Upon reaching different milestones during the development, we invite the client to have a look at the work-in-progress website. If we need any tweaks and changes, they're addressed during this stage.

### 6. Launch
Once you've reviewed the website to your satisfaction, we launch it for the public. Once the website is live, we carry out some important SEO-related setup.

## What happens after launch?
Most of businesses leave you on your own once they've developed your website.

We don't do that.
Our website development service includes a **complementary two-month maintenance contract**. Since we developed your site, we stand by you to see how the site performs. During that time, if something is broken, we fix it. Without you needing to spend extra money.

**Interesting idea:** What if you *never* want to make a change to your website? Great, it will keep running, good as new: no maintenance, no intervention, for years. We call it **fire-and-forget setup**.

## Website should act as an asset
It is like owning a good real-estate property. Sure, you need to invest first but expending big monies month-after-month is not desirable.
