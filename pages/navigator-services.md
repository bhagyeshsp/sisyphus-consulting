A full-project might not be a good fit for many clients. We provide navigator services for such clients. If you're one of such clients, please read on. Want to directly book the call? **Jump here.**

## 3 one-hour calls
Whether tech or design, our navigator services have the same structure:
- High-impact 1:1 advisory
- 3 one-hour calls over a period of one week
- Directly with decision-makers

## How it works
The outline:
- Book the call
- After payment, we'll be in touch with a meeting link and next steps
- Share your tech pain points (database structure, technology selection dilemma, data system etc.) OR design problems in advance
- We'll strategize, solve and advise over three hyper-focused calls
- In the end, leave with clarity, confidence and plan to execute your ideas

## Limited weekly slots
You'd have read in **how-we-work/async-comm** about our need to work long stretch of hours on client work. That's why we can cater to only a limited number of navigator calls every week.

After payment, we'll reach you with a meeting link and next steps. It would take one business day to get back to you. Be assured that, before we get on a call, we would have done our homework.
