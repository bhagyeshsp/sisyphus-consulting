A full-project might not be a good fit for many clients. We provide navigator services for such clients. If you're one of such clients, please read on. Want to directly book the call? **[Jump↓]({{'/navigator-services#limited-weekly-slots' | relative_url}})**

## 3 one-hour calls
Whether tech or design, our navigator services have the same structure:
- High-impact 1:1 advisory
- 3 one-hour calls over a period of one week
- Directly with decision-makers

## How it works
The outline:
- Book the call
- After payment, we'll be in touch with a meeting link and next steps
- Share your context in advance.
    - For **tech-related** call, you may want our advisory on matter such as: database schema review, data flow diagram, workflow review, AI tools usage, automation suggestion, UX/UI review, store optimization, product catalogue review, etc. We will require full context to help you best.
    - For **design-related** call, you may need us to advise on things such as: mood boards, logo concepts, metaphor/iconography, colour palette, typography, sketch critique, book design-related questions etc. We will require assets and documents related to them.
- We'll strategize, solve and advise over three hyper-focused one hour calls
- In the end, you'll leave with clarity, confidence and plan to execute your ideas

## Limited weekly slots
You'd have read in [How We Work]({{'/how-we-work#primarily-asynchronous-occasionally-synchronous' | relative_url}}) about our need to work long stretch of hours on client work. That's why we can cater to only a limited number of navigator calls every week.

After payment, we'll email you the next steps for arranging our first call. It would take one business day to get back to you.

Before our call, we'll do our homework. After our last call, we will summarize our discussion in a brief write-up and share with you for your record.
